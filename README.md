This is a Flutter application that demonstrates a simple guessing game with a video player component. The app generates a list of coordinate guesses and allows the user to play a video. The user can then make predictions about the last card number before or after the video ends.

App Structure
The app consists of two main components:

MyApp
MyApp is the root widget that sets up the main MaterialApp and arranges the user interface.
It includes MyHomePage (which displays the guessing game) and VideoArea (which handles video playback).
MyHomePage
MyHomePage is a stateful widget responsible for displaying the guessing game.
The calculateCoordinates function generates a list of coordinate guesses and displays them in a ListView.
The user can input their predictions in the text field and choose whether the last card is before or after the video ends using radio buttons.
VideoArea
VideoArea is a stateless widget responsible for displaying the video player.
It uses the VideoPlayerController to play a video from a URL.
The user can control video playback using a play/pause button.
Usage
Launch the app on your device or emulator.
Tap the play button in the video player area to start the video.
Make your predictions about the last card number and its position relative to the video.
Observe the list of generated guesses updating as time passes.
The guessing game is disabled while the video is playing.
